     <p>Cheesecake, especially strawberry cheesecake, is my favorite desert. It is so creamy and fruity. It just is the perfect desert after any meal.</p>

       <p>Lobster is my favorite food to eat if I have money to spend. It can be a bit pricey but the taste is so worth it. Dipped in melted butter, lobster it so tender and juicy. Thinking about the flavor makes my mouth water.</p>
      <img src="http://img1.10bestmedia.com/Images/Photos/330005/Sushi-Hana-from-web-site_54_990x660.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Sushi is another favorite that can get a little pricey. I really love seafood and with sushi it allows you to taste all sorts of different fish paired with vegetables. If you are not in the mood to pick one plate to eat, a sushi bar can be the perfect place to go out.</p>
